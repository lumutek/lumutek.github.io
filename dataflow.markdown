# Lukas Mueller

## Project Name: DataFlow

### Data Science Dashboard with sklearn, multiple linear/logistic regression, ensemble learning, data cleaning, and data visualization.

### Overview:
Having recently completed the Google Advanced Data Analytics Professional track, I thought it would be a great idea to continue cultivating my new data science skills.
Like the MLDash project, this project uses previous work as a starting point, and iterative development will take place as a series of enhancements. The state of the code 
before and after each enhancement is provided to illustrate code evolution. A chronological update summaries can be easily viewed in the narratives section.

#### Initial Commit
