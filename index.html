        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>I am a computer scientist with a concentration in Software Engineering; I also have a background in IT and neuroscience. 
          I am currently working toward becoming a Machine Learning Engineer, and hope to use my skills to benefit humankind.</p><br/>

            <p>I developed the MLDash application for my Computer Science Capstone project. MLDash is a Jupyter Dash app that allows a user to 
              tune machine learning hyperparameters for a reinforcement learning algorithm. Hyperparameters and performance metrics are stored 
              in a MongoDB database, then displayed in the dashboard as a data table and data visualization graphics.</p><br/>
            <p>##### The MLDash project was written in the Spring of 2023. As an aspiring machine learning engineer, and software engineer by 
              discipline, I recognize the value in making complicated tasks more accessible to the common user. Training machine learning 
              algorithms requires tuning their (sometimes numerous) hyperparameters and hoping that the changes made boost model performance, 
              while also keeping track of the changes that have been made. The main purpose of this project is to simplify this task for users, 
              automate record keeping, and generate data visualizations that can assist users in the selection of more optimal hyperparameters. 
              While the project currently hosts a single AI algorithm, OpenAI Gym's Cartpole-v1, I anticipate that additional models can be 
              added as modules over time. The algorithm used to solve the cartpole problem is a deep-Q reinforcement learning algorithm that 
              solves the problem of balancing a pole attached to a cart that moves on a frictionless rail. The model acquires data from the 
              environment (observation space) and determines which sequence of actions results in better performance for each situation. The 
              model trains itself by replaying experiences it acquires, prioritizing samples of its experience based on how different those 
              experiences were from its predictions. The model begins training with a higher likelihood to explore, allowing it to gather new 
              experiences by trying different action sequences; as training continues, the model relies less on exploration and more on the 
              exploitation of the experiences it has gathered.</p><br/>
